# Query Optimization Report

## Initial Query Analysis

### Query Characteristics
- 4 table joins (bookings, users, properties, payments)
- Date range filter on bookings
- Sorting by check-in date
- Retrieves all columns from joined tables

### Performance Issues Identified
1. **Unnecessary Columns**: Retrieving all columns when only some are needed
2. **Inefficient Join**: Payments join retrieves all payment records per booking
3. **No Limit**: Retrieving all matching rows when likely only some are needed
4. **Missing Indexes**: No optimal indexes for the date range filter
