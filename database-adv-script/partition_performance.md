# Partitioning Performance Report

## Implementation Overview
Partitioned the `bookings` table by `check_in_date` with:
- 5 partitions covering different time periods
- Maintained all constraints and indexes
- Added partition-specific indexes

## Test Queries

### Query 1: Recent bookings (2024 only)
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM bookings
WHERE check_in_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31';
